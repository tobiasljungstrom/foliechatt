#Foliechatt
A secure end-to-end encrypted chat client and server architecture.
#Introduction
Foliechatt (Tin Foil Chat) is a three-week project resulting from a course in software security at Teknikh√∂gskolan in Gothenburg. The purpose of the project was to create a piece of software that, to as large an extent as possible, was secure from unautorized access.

We decided to make an encypted chat system, with the goal of allowing people to communicate with absolute certainty that no one can listen in on the conversation.
