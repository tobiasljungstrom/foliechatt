#Foliechatt
A secure end-to-end encrypted chat client and server architecture.
#Introduction
Foliechatt (Tin Foil Chat) is a three-week project resulting from a course in software security at Teknikh√∂gskolan in Gothenburg. The purpose of the project was to create a piece of software that, to as large an extent as possible, was secure from unautorized access.

We decided to make an encypted chat system, with the goal of allowing people to communicate with absolute certainty that no one can listen in on the conversation.
#Our security implementation
##Log in, and user verification
We have chosen to implement a user database, where we store users with a unique **alias**, as well as an **e-mail address** and a **password**. The latter two are for authentication, and the former is for identification and message routing. The purpose of this system is that users can only access the services if they are logged in. This in turn should ensure that a user cannot adopt another users alias in an attempt to trick other users of a chat room. In other words: *if a user with a certain alias shows up in a chat room you can be sure that it is the account associated with this alias that messages are sent to and not another.*

The passwords are stored in salted hash values using the **SHA512** hasing algorithm.

##Key distribution
We've opted for an implementation of **public key cryptography**, using our backend as a **public key server**. Each chat room keeps a list of the users participating in it, where each entry is the user alias and it's corresponding public key. This list is then shared with all the participants of the room.
##Message encryption
When a user wants to send a message, the text will be encrypted with **OpenPGP**, once for each recipient, and then sent to the server. The server recieves the messages and routes them to the intended reciever, using user alias as the address.

When a message is sent, the sender of the message will themselves be on the list of recipients. When the sender recieves, decrypts, and displayes the message they just sent, this is an indication that everything went all right.
#Known issues
* Nothing prevents a user from entering a weak password
* 
#Future features
* Proper logging
